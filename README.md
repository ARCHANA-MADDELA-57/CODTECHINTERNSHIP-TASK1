The main goal of my internship in creating a sales performance dashboard using PowerBI 
was likely to analyze and visualize sales data to provide insights for decision-making. 
It aimed to enhance understanding of sales performance metrics and trends.

**Key Activities**:

creating data models, designing visualizations, and developing interactive dashboards. 
I might have also conducted data analysis to extract meaningful insights from the sales data.

I used Microsoft PowerBI as the primary tool for data visualization. 
I might have also worked with data sources such as Excel, or csv data repositories to extract and transform data for analysis.

The key insights I might have gained from the sales performance dashboard could include identifying top-performing products or regions, 
tracking sales trends over time, understanding customer behavior, evaluating the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, 
and pinpointing areas for improvement in sales strategies.
